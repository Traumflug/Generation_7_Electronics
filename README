Archiving hint: In late summer 2023, Github started to enforce 2FA (Two Factor
                Authentication), so I had to archive it before losing control
                over it.  See also https://github.com/Traumflug/Generation_7_Electronics/issues/28

Design Goals

 * PCB easily to manufacture on a RepRap.
 * All parts on one board. Except for the Opto Endstops, of course.
 * Enough components to run a Mendel or Huxley with extruder and heated bed.
 * Easy to set up. For example, this would include an USB port.
 * Well available and cheap parts.
 * Based on the ATmega644.
 * Well suited for community driven development. 

Features

 * Single board solution.
 * Single sided PCB.
 * Pololu stepper drivers, exchangeable.
 * 4x stepper motor drivers with 1/16 microstepping.
 * TODO: on-board USB-RS232 converter.
 * Integrated hardware for driving one extruder (stepper, heater and thermistor).
 * Integrated hardware for a heated bed (heater, thermistor).
 * Integrated hardware for driving a fan.
 * Ready to be hooked up on a generic PC power supply unit (PSU).
 * Use of standard connectors.
 * Debug LEDs for power, Fan and both heater outputs.
 * Can turn PSU on and off in software.
 * Reset button.
